my name's sam, i develop little things, i hope to develop bigger things in the future.

i don't have any formal education above gcse if you're wondering about qualification for jobs. hire me anyway though pretty please? :3

won't be finding much out about me here... trying to not put my personal info online. if i slip up and leak something feel free to pull request the repository or whatever works. probably faster than tweeting it

[check out the github repo for this site here](https://github.com/voidsf/newsite)

email me with any queries at admin@samthings.gay
